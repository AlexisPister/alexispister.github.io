Communication research offers a method of analyzing interactions between individuals on a quantitative and comprehensive basis which allows us to achieve a more reliable picture of the Roman social structure. This paper tests an hypothesis about the positioning of Roman senators and knights in the social structure of Roman society. A corpus of ancient texts is analyzed, coding who-to-whom relations in 280 letters written by Cicero from 68 B.C. to 43 B.C. Network analysis is performed. This study produces two kinds of benefit. In terms of the historical question at hand, the results show that senators and knights occupied structurally similar positions in Cicero's network of relations. These results cast doubt on a traditional view of a sharp division between senators and knights, and lend support to a more recent approach. In terms of communication methodology, this research shows that the value of applying relational content-network analysis of messages to test hypotheses about social systems when questioning the actual participants about their social relations is not feasible.},

As Infomap cannot be applied to bipartite networks for theoretical reasons, our solution is to work with the primary projected network. We apply both algorithms to four projected networks of increasing size and complexity. Our results support the conclusion that the clusters found by Infomap are meaningful and better represent ground truth in the bipartite network than those found by Louvain.},

  abstract = {In Correlation and Regression Analysis: A Historian's Guide Thomas J. Archdeacon provides historians with a practical introduction to the use of correlation and regression analysis. The book concentrates on the kinds of analysis that form the broad range of statistical methods used in the social sciences. It enables historians to understand and to evaluate critically the quantitative analyses that they are likely to encounter in journal literature and monographs reporting research findings in the social sciences. Without attempting to be a text in basic statistics, the book provides enough background information to allow readers to grasp the essentials of correlation and regression. Correlation analysis refers to the measurement of association between or among variables, and regression analysis focuses primarily on the use of linear models to predict changes in the value taken by one variable in terms of changes in the values of a set of explanatory variables. The book also discusses diagnostic methods for identifying shortcomings in regression models, the use of regression to analyze causation, and the application of regression and related procedures to the study of problems containing categorical as well as numerical data. Archdeacon asserts that knowing how statistical procedures are computed can clarify the theoretical structures underlying them and is essential for recognizing the conditions under which their use is appropriate. The book does not shy away from the mathematics of statistical analysis; but Archdeacon presents concepts carefully and explains the operation of equations step by step. Unlike many works in the field, the book does not assume that readers have mathematical training beyond basic algebra and geometry. In the hope of promoting the role of quantitative analysis in his discipline, Archdeacon discusses the theory and methods behind the most important interpretive paradigm for quantitative research in the social sciences. Correlation and Regression Analysis introduces statistical techniques that are indispensable to historians and enhances the presentation of them with practical examples from scholarly works.},

To address it, we have created the first dataset for atypical animacy detection, based on nineteenth-century sentences in English, with machines represented as either animate or inanimate. Our method builds on recent innovations in language modeling, specifically BERT contextualized word embeddings, to better capture fine-grained contextual properties of words. We present a fully unsupervised pipeline, which can be easily adapted to different contexts, and report its performance on an established animacy dataset and our newly introduced resource. We show that our method provides a substantially more accurate characterization of atypical animacy, especially when applied to highly complex forms of language use.},

  abstract = {Networks are models that help us understanding and thinking about relationships between entities in the real world. Many of these networks are dynamic, i.e. connectivity changes over time. Understanding changes in connectivity means to understand interactions between elements of complex systems; how people create and break up friendship relations, how signals get passed in the brain, how business collaborations evolve, or how food-webs restructure after environmental changes. However, understanding static networks is already difficult, due to size, density, attributes and particular motifs; changes over time very much increase this complexity. Quantification of change is often insufficient, but beyond an analysis that is driven by technology and algorithms, humans dispose a unique capability of understanding and interpreting information in data, based on vision and cognition. This dissertation explores ways to interactively explore dynamic networks by means of visualization. I develop and evaluate techniques to unfold the complexity of dynamic networks, making them understandable by looking at them from different angles, decomposing them into their parts and relating the parts in novel ways. While most techniques for dynamic network visualization rely on one particular type of view on the data, complementary visualizations allow for higher-level exploration and analysis. Covering three aspects Tasks, Visualization Design and Evaluation, I develop and evaluate the following unfolding techniques: (i) temporal navigation between individual time steps of a network and improved animated transitions to better understand changes, (ii) designs for the comparison of weighted graphs, (iii) the Matrix Cube, a space-time cube based on adjacency matrices, allowing to visualize dense dynamic networks by, as well as GraphCuisine, a system to (iv) generate synthetic networks with the primary focus on evaluating visualizations in user studies. In order to inform the design and evaluation of visualizations, we (v) provide a task taxonomy capturing users' tasks when exploring dynamic networks. Finally, (vi) the idea of unfolding networks with Matrix Cubes is generalized to other data sets that can be represented in space-time cubes (videos, geographical data, etc.). Visualizations in these domains can inspire visualizations for dynamic networks, and vice-versa. We propose a taxonomy of operations, describing how 3D space-time cubes are decomposed into a large variety of 2D visualizations. These operations help us exploring the design space for visualizing and interactively unfolding dynamic networks and other spatio-temporal data, as well as may serve users as a mental model of the data.},

  abstract = {We report on a controlled user study comparing three visualization environments for common 3D exploration. Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user’s real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis methods seek to partition a data set into homogeneous subgroups. It is useful in a wide variety of applications, including document processing and modern genetics. Conventional clustering methods are unsupervised, meaning that there is no outcome variable nor is anything known about the relationship between the observations in the data set. In many situations, however, information about the clusters is available in addition to the values of the features. For example, the cluster labels of some observations may be known, or certain observations may be known to belong to the same cluster. In other cases, one may wish to identify clusters that are associated with a particular outcome variable. This review describes several clustering algorithms (known as ‘semi-supervised clustering’ methods) that can be applied in these situations. The majority of these methods are modifications of the popular k-means clustering method, and several of them will be described in detail. A brief description of some other semi-supervised clustering algorithms is also provided.

Several techniques have been proposed for partitioning these graphs into clusters that are homogeneous with respect to both semantic attributes and to the structure of the graph. However, time and space complexities of state of the art algorithms limit their scalability to medium-sized graphs. We propose SToC (for Semantic-Topological Clustering), a fast and scalable algorithm for partitioning large attributed graphs. The approach is robust, being compatible both with categorical and with quantitative attributes, and it is tailorable, allowing the user to weight the semantic and topological components. Further, the approach does not require the user to guess in advance the number of clusters. SToC relies on well known approximation techniques such as bottom-k sketches, traditional graph-theoretic concepts, and a new perspective on the composition of heterogeneous distance measures. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to efficiently compute high-quality partitions of large scale attributed graphs.},

  abstract = {Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs in which edges (hyperedges) can connect more than two vertices-as opposed to ordinary graphs where edges involve only two vertices. Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.

We contribute a consistent definition of EVA through review of the relevant literature, and an empirical evaluation of existing assumptions regarding how analysts perform EVA using Tableau, a popular visual analysis tool. We present the results of a study where 27 Tableau users answered various analysis questions across 3 datasets. We measure task performance, identify recurring patterns across participants' analyses, and assess variance from task specificity and dataset. We find striking differences between existing assumptions and the collected data. Participants successfully completed a variety of tasks, with over 80\% accuracy across focused tasks with measurably correct answers. The observed cadence of analyses is surprisingly slow compared to popular assumptions from the database community. We find significant overlap in analyses across participants, showing that EVA behaviors can be predictable. Furthermore, we find few structural differences between behavior graphs for open-ended and more focused exploration tasks.},

The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive list of reordering algorithms published in different fields such as statistics, bioinformatics, or graph theory. While several of these algorithms are described in publications and others are available in software libraries and programs, there is little awareness of what is done across all fields. Our survey aims at describing these reordering algorithms in a unified manner to enable a wide audience to understand their differences and subtleties. We organize this corpus in a consistent manner, independently of the application or research field. We also provide practical guidance on how to select appropriate algorithms depending on the structure and size of the matrix to reorder, and point to implementations when available.},

Clustering algorithms such as hard and fuzzy c-means, based on optimizing sums of squared errors objective functions, suffer from a third problem: (P3) a tendency to recommend solutions that equalize cluster populations. The semi-supervised c-means algorithms introduced in this paper attempt to overcome these problems domains where a few data from each clas can be labeled. Segmentation of magnetic resonance images is a problem of this type and we use it to illustrate the new algorithm. Our examples show that the semi-supervised approach provides MRI segmentations that are superior to ordinary fuzzy c-means and to the crisp k-nearest neighbor rule and further, that the new method ameliorates (P1)-(P3).},

  abstract = {Social networks collected by historians or sociologists typically have a large number of actors and edge attributes. Applying social network analysis (SNA) algorithms to these networks produces additional attributes such as degree, centrality, and clustering coefficients. Understanding the effects of this plethora of attributes is one of the main challenges of multivariate SNA. We present the design of GraphDice, a multivariate network visualization system for exploring the attribute space of edges and actors. GraphDice builds upon the ScatterDice system for its main multidimensional navigation paradigm, and extends it with novel mechanisms to support network exploration in general and SNA tasks in particular. Novel mechanisms include visualization of attributes of interval type and projection of numerical edge attributes to node attributes. We show how these extensions to the original ScatterDice system allow to support complex visual analysis tasks on networks with hundreds of actors and up to 30 attributes, while providing a simple and consistent interface for interacting with network data.},

Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

Provenance can be captured on varying levels of detail, and in turn activities can be characterized from different granularities. However, current approaches do not support inferring activities that can only be characterized across multiple levels of provenance. We propose a task abstraction framework that consists of a three stage approach, composed of 1) initializing a provenance task hierarchy, 2) parsing the provenance hierarchy by using an abstraction mapping mechanism, and 3) leveraging the task hierarchy in an analytical tool. Furthermore, we identify implications to accommodate iterative refinement, context, variability, and uncertainty during all stages of the framework. We describe a use case which exemplifies our abstraction framework, demonstrating how context can influence the provenance hierarchy to support analysis. The article concludes with an agenda, raising and discussing challenges that need to be considered for successfully implementing such a framework.},

In particular, discovering groups of tightly connected vertices and understanding the relations between those groups is very important in practice. This paper shows how a kernel version of the batch self-organizing map can be used to achieve these goals via kernels derived from the Laplacian matrix of the graph, especially when it is used in conjunction with more classical methods based on the spectral analysis of the graph. The proposed method is used to explore the structure of a medieval social network modelled through a weighted graph that has been directly built from a large corpus of agrarian contracts.},

A great way to get data for exclusive stories is to use the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to request information from public bodies including data and documents. One of the basic principles of data visualisation is to avoid using 3D effects: these not only add unnecessary visual information but it can actively distort the chart.

Specific forms of network analysis are used in the study of diverse structures such as the Internet, interlocking directorates, transportation systems, epidemic spreading, metabolic pathways, the Web graph, electrical circuits, project plans, and so on. There is, however, a broad methodological foundation which is quickly becoming a prerequisite for researchers and practitioners working with network models. From a computer science perspective, network analysis is applied graph theory. Unlike standard graph theory books, the content of this book is organized according to methods for specific levels of analysis (element, group, network) rather than abstract concepts like paths, matchings, or spanning subgraphs. Its topics therefore range from vertex centrality to graph clustering and the evolution of scale-free networks. In 15 coherent chapters, this monograph-like tutorial book introduces and surveys the concepts and methods that drive network analysis, and is thus the first book to do so from a methodological perspective independent of specific application areas.},

  abstract = {Trigger warnings, content warnings, or content notes are alerts about upcoming content that may contain themes related to past negative experiences. Advocates claim that warnings help people to emotionally prepare for or completely avoid distressing material. Critics argue that warnings both contribute to a culture of avoidance at odds with evidence-based treatment practices and instill fear about upcoming content. Recently, a body of psychological research has begun to investigate these claims empirically. We present the results of a meta-analysis of all empirical studies on the effects of these warnings. Overall, we found that warnings have no effect on affective responses to negative material nor on educational outcomes (i.e., comprehension). However, warnings reliably increase anticipatory affect. Findings on avoidance were mixed, suggesting either that warnings have no effect on engagement with material, or that they increase engagement with negative material under specific circumstances. Limitations and implications for policy and therapeutic practice are discussed.},

The collectives are driven by mutual objectives or react to individual direction changes and external influence factors and stimuli. The challenge in visualizing collective movement data is to show space and time of hundreds of movements at the same time to enable the detection of spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, we propose MotionRugs, a novel space efficient technique for visualizing moving groups of entities. Building upon established space-partitioning strategies, our approach reduces the spatial dimensions in each time step to a one-dimensional ordered representation of the individual entities. By design, MotionRugs provides an overlap-free, compact overview of the development of group movements over time and thus, enables analysts to visually identify and explore group-specific temporal patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of fish swarm analysis and report on initial feedback of domain experts from the field of collective behavior.},

  abstract = {This book provides a critical history of the movement associated with the journal Annales, from its foundation in 1929 to the present. This movement has been the single most important force in the development of what is sometimes called ‘the new history’.  Renowned cultural historian, Peter Burke, distinguishes between four main generations in the development of the Annales School. The first generation included Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, who fought against the old historical establishment and founded the journal Annales to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. The second generation was dominated by Fernand Braudel, whose magnificent work on the Mediterranean has become a modern classic. The third generation, deeply associated with the ‘cultural turn’ in historical scholarship, includes recently well-known historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Jacques Le Goff and Georges Duby. This new edition brings us right up to the present, and contemplates the work of a fourth generation, including practitioners such as Roger Chartier, Serge Gruzinski and Jacques Revel. This new generation continued much of the cultural focus of the previous Annales historians, while diversifying further, and becoming increasingly ‘reflexive’, a move that owes much to the sociocultural theories of Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau and Pierre Bourdieu.  Wide-ranging yet concise, this new edition of a classic work of analysis of one of the most important historical movements of the twentieth century will be welcomed by students of history and other social sciences and by the interested general reader.},

  author = {Carberry, Josiah S and Grimley, Ed and Stewart, Martha},
  abstract = {A variety of graph sampling algorithms have been proposed to simplify graph computation and visualization. Despite their specific goals, it is inevitable to filter out a large amount of nodes and edges, thus resulting in structural differences between the sampled and original graphs. Many metrics have been proposed to represent the network structures from different perspectives such as node degree, shortest path and clustering coefficients. Although the value changes of these metrics can reveal the overall statistical differences between the sampled and original graphs, it is still difficult to investigate the detailed distributions of such differences and the underlying reasons for them, which is crucial for accurately evaluating the effectiveness of graph sampling algorithms. In this paper, we propose DiffLens, a difference-driven visualization approach for graph sampling evaluation. First, we thoroughly survey the existing graph evaluation metrics, and classify them into three categories (i.e., neighbor-based, path-based, and structure-based). Then, to avoid investigating every graph evaluation metric, we conduct extensive statistical analysis on different graph datasets to select the most representative metrics for each category. Building upon this, we further propose novel quantification strategies to measure each category of graph differences. Finally, we design a multicolor heatmap to visually present the primary differences across different local areas of a graph, and provide a variety of coordinated views to facilitate the exploration of the underlying reasons for such differences caused by different graph sampling algorithms. Case studies using real-world networks and in-depth expert interviews are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DiffLens in helping graph sampling algorithm developers and users evaluate and compare different graph sampling algorithms.},

Recent collection, digitization, and data curation efforts, however, have made it possible to test that view using social network analysis. Based on this analysis, I show that early Black activist communities cannot be collapsed into the white-led abolitionist circuits. The Colored Conventions and the early Black press operated independently of the anti-slavery societies across six regionally distinct communities. A brief survey of these regional communities points to the wealth of research opportunities among robust, rediscovered, and reassembled archives into areas that speak to enduring questions of rights, resistance, and community-building. These inquiries simultaneously demonstrate the need for careful attention to Black data curation practices, especially with regard to inclusive approaches to scattered archives.},

  abstract = {Data clustering is a common unsupervised learning method frequently used in exploratory data analysis. However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial, requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances. The number of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the large clustering space so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. We introduce Clustrophile 2, a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis. Clustrophile 2 guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings. To this end, Clustrophile 2 contributes a novel feature, the Clustering Tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations. We evaluate Clustrophile 2 through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients. Results suggest that Clustrophile 2 improves the speed and effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis for both experts and non-experts.},

Widely used in molecular biology in the study of protein interaction networks, the enumeration, in a network, of all possible subgraphs of a limited size (usually around four or five nodes), often called graphlets, can only be found in a few works dealing with social networks. In the present work, we apply this approach to an original corpus of about 10,000 non-overlapping Facebook ego networks gathered from voluntary participants by a survey application. To deal with so many similar networks, we adapt the relative graphlet frequency to a measure that we call graphlet representativity, which we show to be more effective to classify random networks having slight structural differences. From our data, we produce two clusterings, one of graphlets (paths, star-like, holes, light triangles, and dense), one of networks. The latter is presented with a visualization scheme using our representativity measure. We describe the distinct structural characteristics of the five clusters of Facebook ego networks so obtained and discuss the empirical differences between results obtained with 4-node and 5-node graphlets. We also provide suggestions of follow-ups of this work, both in sociology and in network science.},

  abstract = {We present Graphite, a system that allows the user to visually construct a query pattern, finds both its exact and approximate matching subgraphs in large attributed graphs, and visualizes the matches. For example, in a social network where a person's occupation is an attribute, the user can draw a 'star' query for "finding a CEO who has interacted with a Secretary, a Manager, and an Accountant, or a structure very similar to this". Graphite uses the G-Ray algorithm to run the query against a user-chosen data graph, gaining all of its benefits, namely its high speed, scalability, and its ability to find both exact and near matches. Therefore, for the example above, Graphite tolerates indirect paths between, say, the CEO and the Accountant, when no direct path exists. Graphite uses fast algorithms to estimate node proximities when finding matches, enabling it to scale well with the graph database size.We demonstrate Graphitepsilas usage and benefits using the DBLP author-publication graph, which consists of 356 K nodes and 1.9 M edges. A demo video of Graphite can be downloaded at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ dchau/graphite/graphite.mov.},

In this article, we document this growth over time, discuss several of the important concepts that are used in the application of network approaches to archaeology, and introduce the other articles in this special issue on networks in archaeology. We argue that the suitability and contribution of network science techniques within particular archaeological research contexts can be usefully explored by scrutinizing the past phenomena under study, how these are abstracted into concepts, and how these in turn are represented as network data. For this reason, each of the articles in this special issue is discussed in terms of the phenomena that they seek to address, the abstraction in terms of concepts that they use to study connectivity, and the representations of network data that they employ in their analyses. The approaches currently being used are diverse and interdisciplinary, which we think are evidence of a healthy exploratory stage in the application of network science in archaeology. To facilitate further innovation, application, and collaboration, we also provide a glossary of terms that are currently being used in network science and especially those in the applications to archaeological case studies.},

Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace. This paper provides an illustrative use case, a technical description of ADE, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach.},

Les chantiers royaux piémontais dans la première moitié du XVIIIe~siècle offrent un cadre d’étude intéressant. La documentation à disposition, et notamment les contrats publics, enregistre le moment de la constitution de ce réseau, et permet d’en mettre en lumière la spécificité, à savoir un fort dynamisme et un renouvellement continu. Le but de cet article est de reconstruire le cadre temporel qui a orienté les choix des acteurs en donnant lieu à ces configurations et à ce dynamisme. La formalisation du corpus à l’aide d’un réseau biparti (2-mode network) associant documents et individus permet de disposer d’un moyen efficace pour accéder aux différentes dimensions susceptibles d’éclairer la compréhension du réseau des entrepreneurs, de juger de sa pertinence et de ses évolutions. C’est aussi le moyen d’observer les temporalités propres à chaque composante de ce corpus~: le cours de la commande publique lié à la situation politique de l’État Sarde, les séquences opératoires de chaque chantier qui interpellent les différentes spécialisations des contrats et des contractants, les trajectoires relationnelles des entrepreneurs (leurs profils d’interventions et leurs rôles qui changent à chaque contrat), les parcours biographiques et migratoires de ces individus. C’est à l’intérieur de cet ensemble complexe d’interactions, aux temporalités divergentes, que s’organisent les logiques d’actions des protagonistes, en fonction de ce qu’ils en perçoivent. Les pratiques qui en découlent façonnent le milieu professionnel des entrepreneurs du bâtiment à Turin de la première moitié du XVIIIe~siècle.},

The piece table method is explained in detail and its advantages are presented. The design space of sequence data structures is examined and several variations on the ones listed above are presented. These sequence data structures are compared experimentally and evaluated based on a number of criteria. The experimental comparison is done by implementing each data structure in an editing simulator and testing it using a synthetic load of many thousands of edits. We also report on experiments on the senstivity of the results to variations in the parameters used to generate the synthetic editing load.},

  abstract = {Many real world data can be modeled by a graph with a set of nodes interconnected to each other by multiple relationships. Such a rich graph is called multilayer graph or network. Providing useful visualization tools to support the query process for such graphs is challenging. Although many approaches have addressed the visual query construction, few efforts have been done to provide a contextualized exploration of query results and suggestion strategies to refine the original query. This is due to several issues such as i) the size of the graphs ii) the large number of retrieved results and iii) the way they can be organized to facilitate their exploration. In this paper, we present VERTIGo, a novel visual platform to query, explore and support the analysis of large multilayer graphs. VERTIGo provides coordinated views to navigate and explore the large set of retrieved results at different granularity levels. In addition, the proposed system supports the refinement of the query by visual suggestions to guide the user through the exploration process. Two examples and a user study demonstrate how VERTIGo can be used to perform visual analysis (query, exploration, and suggestion) on real world multilayer networks.},

By tracking provenance data, visualization designers can provide a wide variety of functionality, ranging from action recovery (undo/redo), reproducibility, collaboration and sharing, to logging in support of quantitative and longitudinal evaluation. However, no widely used library that can provide that functionality is current available. As a consequence, visualization designers either develop ad hoc solutions that are rarely comprehensive, or do not track provenance at all. In this paper, we introduce a web-based software library - Trrack - that is designed for easy integration in existing or future visualization systems. Trrack supports a wide range of use cases, from simple action recovery, to capturing intent and reasoning, and can be used to share states with collaborators and store provenance on a server. Trrack also includes an optional provenance visualization component that supports annotation of states and aggregation of events.},

With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

In many application domains, relationships between entities are not temporally stable, which means that cluster structures and cluster memberships also may vary across time. Our approach merges multiple force-directed layouts at different time points into a single comprehensive visualization that provides a big picture overview of the most significant clusters within a user-defined period of time. TimeArcs also supports a range of interactive features, such as allowing users to drill-down in order to see details about a particular cluster. To highlight the benefits of this technique, we demonstrate its application to various datasets, including the IMDB co-star network, a dataset showing conflicting evidences within biomedical literature of protein interactions, and collocated popular phrases obtained from political blogs.},

  abstract = {First published in 1941, Deep South is the cooperative effort of a team of social anthropologists to document the economic, racial, and cultural character of the Jim Crow South through a study of a representative rural Mississippi community. Researchers Allison Davis, Burleigh B. Gardner, and Mary R. Gardner lived among the people of Natchez, Mississippi, as they investigated how class and caste informed daily life in a typical southern community. This Southern Classics edition of their study offers contemporary students of history a provocative collection of primary material gathered by conscientious and well-trained participant-observers, who found then, as now, intertwined social and economic inequalities at the root of racial tensions. Expanding on earlier studies of community stratification by social class, researchers in the Deep South Project introduced the additional concept of caste, which parsed a community through rigid social ranks assigned at birth and unalterable through life, a concept readily identifiable in the racial divisions of the Jim Crow South. As African American researchers, Davis and his wife, Elizabeth, along with his assistant St. Clair Drake, were able to gain unrivaled access to the black community in rural Mississippi, unavailable to their white counterparts. Through their interviews and experiences, the authors vividly capture the nuances in caste-enforcing systems of tenant-landlord relations, local government, and law enforcement. But the chief achievement of Deep South is its rich analysis of how the southern economic system, and sharecropping in particular, functioned to maintain rigid caste divisions along racial lines. In the new introduction to this edition, Jennifer Jensen Wallach situates this germinal study within the field of social anthropology and against the backdrop of similar community studies of the era. She also details the subsequent careers of this distinguished team of researchers.},

  abstract = {Clickstream data has the potential to provide insights into e-commerce consumer behavior, but previous techniques fall short of handling the scale and complexity of real-world datasets because they require relatively clean and small input. We present Segmentifier, a novel visual analytics interface that supports an iterative process of refining collections of action sequences into meaningful segments. We present task and data abstractions for clickstream data analysis, leading to a high-level model built around an iterative view-refine-record loop with outcomes of conclude with an answer, export segment for further analysis in downstream tools, or abandon the question for a more fruitful analysis path. Segmentifier supports fast and fluid refinement of segments through tightly coupled visual encoding and interaction with a rich set of views that show evocative derived attributes for segments, sequences, and actions in addition to underlying raw sequences. These views support fast and fluid refinement of segments through filtering and partitioning attribute ranges. Interactive visual queries on custom action sequences are aggregated according to a three-level hierarchy. Segmentifier features a detailed glyph-based visual history of the automatically recorded analysis process showing the provenance of each segment as an analysis path of attribute constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a usage scenario with real-world data and a case study documenting the insights gained by a corporate e-commerce analyst.},

However, little evidence exists of how techniques are applied and whether they are effective. We examined the use of the analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH)—a technique designed to reduce “confirmation bias.” Fifty intelligence analysts were randomly assigned to use ACH or not when completing a hypothesis testing task that had probabilistic ground truth. Data on analysts' judgement processes and conclusions were collected using written protocols that were then coded for statistical analyses. We found that ACH-trained analysts did not follow all of the steps of ACH. There was mixed evidence for ACH's ability to reduce confirmation bias, and we observed that ACH may increase judgement inconsistency and error. It may be prudent for the intelligence community to consider the conditions under which ACH would prove useful and to explore alternatives.},

In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice.},

In \&lt;em\&gt;The Discovery of Grounded Theory, \&lt;/em\&gt;Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important enterprise of how the discovery of theory from data—systematically obtained and analyzed in social research—can be furthered. The discovery of theory from data—grounded theory—is a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;In Part I of the book, "Generation Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part II, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part III, "Implications of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;em\&gt;The Discovery of Grounded Theory \&lt;/em\&gt;is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena—political, educational, economic, industrial— especially If their studies are based on qualitative data.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.},

This is the question we asked ourselves in our collaborative project Mapping the Republic of Letters.

Beyond cliometrics, what new ways of discovery and analysis do today’s big data offer? What can we learn by visualizing the archives and databases that are increasingly accessible and viewable online? In a variety of case studies focusing on metadata (in the letters of John Locke, Athanasius Kircher, Benjamin Franklin, and Voltaire, and in the travels of those engaging in the Grand Tour), we experimented with visualizations to produce maps of the known and unknown quantities in our datasets, and to represent intellectual, cultural, and geographical boundaries. In the process, we experienced collaborative authorship, and worked with designers and programmers to create an open access suite of visualization tools specifically for humanities scholars, Palladio.

  abstract = {Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking of large, complex datasets through interactively exploring visualizations generated by statistical models. For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts' mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization. Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user's feedback into account.},

  author = {Epperson, Will and Gorantla, Vaishnavi and Moritz, Dominik and Perer, Adam},
  abstract = {Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (“live”) and the other updates only on demand (“dead”). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91\% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than extra profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support.},

De tendance dominante, l’analyse des réseaux «~structuraliste~» s’attache surtout aux descriptions qui, en termes relationnels, redistribuent les rôles des objets sociologiques. Cependant, il existe également une tradition minoritaire d’analyse des réseaux qui étudie principalement les liens sociaux existant entre les individus dans différents contextes sociaux. L’auteur plaide pour l’importance acquise par ces réseaux au cours des trajectoires individuelles et revendique qu’ils fournissent une base pour des descriptions qui ne soient pas uniquement structurées par les catégories sociologiques traditionnelles ou une logique individuelle. Son contenu incite à la révision radicale des catégories sociales (classes, ethnicité...), révision promise mais non réellement menée à son terme par l’analyse structurelle des réseaux, L’auteur nous montre comment les méthodes dominantes d’analyse des réseaux font abstraction des modèles de réseaux qui intéressent la tradition alternative.},

Groups can be disjoint or overlapping, and might be organized hierarchically. However, the underlying graph still needs to be represented for analyzing the data in more depth. This work surveys research in visualizing group structures as part of graph diagrams. A particular focus is the explicit visual encoding of groups, rather than only using graph layout to implicitly indicate groups. We introduce a taxonomy of visualization techniques structuring the field into four main categories: visual node attributes vary properties of the node representation to encode the grouping, juxtaposed approaches use two separate visualizations, superimposed techniques work with two aligned visual layers, and embedded visualizations tightly integrate group and graph representation. We discuss results from evaluations of those techniques as well as main areas of application. Finally, we report future challenges based on interviews we conducted with leading researchers of the field.},

  abstract = {Graph pattern matching is fundamental to social network analysis. Traditional techniques are subgraph isomorphism and graph simulation. However, these notions often impose too strong a topological constraint on graphs to find meaningful matches. Worse still, graphs in the real world are typically large, with millions of nodes and billions of edges. It is often prohibitively expensive to compute matches in such graphs. With these comes the need for revising the notions of graph pattern matching and for developing techniques of querying large graphs, to effectively and efficiently identify social communities or groups. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in the study of graph pattern matching in social networks. (1) We present several revisions of the traditional notions of graph pattern matching to find sensible matches in social networks. (2) We provide boundedness analyses of incremental graph pattern matching, in response to frequent updates to social networks. (3) To cope with large real-life graphs, we propose a framework of query preserving graph compression, which retains only information necessary for answering a certain class of queries of users' choice. (4) We also address pattern matching in distributed graphs, and in particular, advocate the use of partial evaluation techniques. Finally, we identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {We live in an era where data is abundant and growing rapidly; databases storing big data sprawl past memory and computation limits, and across distributed systems. New hardware and software systems have been built to sustain this growth in terms of storage management and predictive computation. However, these infrastructures, while good for data at scale, do not well support exploratory data analysis (EDA) as, for instance, commonly used in Visual Analytics. EDA allows human users to make sense of data with little or no known model on this data and is essential in many application domains, from network security and fraud detection to epidemiology and preventive medicine. Data exploration is done through an iterative loop where analysts interact with data through computations that return results, usually shown with visualizations, which in turn are interacted with by the analyst again. Due to human cognitive constraints, exploration needs highly responsive system response times: at 500 ms, users change their querying behavior; past five or ten seconds, users abandon tasks or lose attention. As datasets grow and computations become more complex, response time suffers. To address this problem, a new computation paradigm has emerged in the last decade under several names: online aggregation in the database community; progressive, incremental, or iterative visualization in other communities. It consists of splitting long computations into a series of approximate results improving with time; in this process, partial or approximate results are then rapidly returned to the user and can be interacted with in a fluent and iterative fashion. With the increasing growth in data, such progressive data analysis approaches will become one of the leading paradigms for data exploration systems, but it also will require major changes in the algorithms, data structures, and visualization tools. This Dagstuhl Seminar was set out to discuss and address these challenges, by bringing together researchers from the different involved research communities: database, visualization, and machine learning. Thus far, these communities have often been divided by a gap hindering joint efforts in dealing with forthcoming challenges in progressive data analysis and visualization. The seminar gave a platform for these researchers and practitioners to exchange their ideas, experience, and visions, jointly develop strategies to deal with challenges, and create a deeper awareness of the implications of this paradigm shift. The implications are technical, but also human--both perceptual and cognitive--and the seminar provided a holistic view of the problem by gathering specialists from all the communities.},

  abstract = {Many statements made by historians are quantitative statements, involving the use of measurable historical evidence. The historian who uses quantitative methods to analyse and interpret such information needs to be well acquainted with the particular methods and techniques of analysis and to be able to make the best use of the data that are available. There is an increasing need for training in such methods and in the interpretation of the large volume of literature now using quantitative techniques. Dr Floud’s text, which is relevant to all branches of historical inquiry, provides a straightforward and intelligible introduction for all students and research workers. The simpler and more useful techniques of descriptive and analytical statistics are described, up to the level of simple linear regression. Historical examples are used throughout, and great attention is paid to the need to ensure that the techniques are consistent with the quality of the data and with the historical problems they are intended to solve. Attention is paid to problems of the analysis of time series, which are of particular use to historians. No previous knowledge of statistics is assumed, and the simple mathematical techniques that are used are fully and clearly explained, without the use of more mathematical knowledge than is provided by an O-level course. A bibliography is provided to guide historians towards the most useful further reading. This student friendly text was first published in 1973.},

  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. IncreasingLy, information visuaLization tools support such comparisons explicitLy, beyond simply aLLowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a generaL understanding of comparative visualization and faciLitating the development of more comparative visualization tools.},

Each child can choose two others, for results that suggest that sociabilities are changing over time: the proportion of attractions between boys and girls decrease, community structures are formed and then disappear, etc. Sociological and mathematical interests of this work have already been discussed in thousands of publications. This post simply questions the visual practices introduced by Moreno and compares them to a more modern way of visualizing such networks. It is clear that the hand drawing causes a visual bias, particularly because of Moreno’s decision to separate girls and boys into two predefined groups. Visualizations below, for the 8 classes (1st to 8th grade) show that this bipartition is not always justified since communities are formed inside them (the inter-sexual “bridges” between boys and girls are not the only structural bridges between cliques).},

  abstract = {Answering questions about complex issues often requires analysts to take into account information contained in multiple interconnected datasets. A common strategy in analyzing and visualizing large and heterogeneous data is dividing it into meaningful subsets. Interesting subsets can then be selected and the associated data and the relationships between the subsets visualized. However, neither the extraction and manipulation nor the comparison of subsets is well supported by state-of-the-art techniques. In this paper we present Domino, a novel multiform visualization technique for effectively representing subsets and the relationships between them. By providing comprehensive tools to arrange, combine, and extract subsets, Domino allows users to create both common visualization techniques and advanced visualizations tailored to specific use cases. In addition to the novel technique, we present an implementation that enables analysts to manage the wide range of options that our approach offers. Innovative interactive features such as placeholders and live previews support rapid creation of complex analysis setups. We introduce the technique and the implementation using a simple example and demonstrate scalability and effectiveness in a use case from the field of cancer genomics.},

Directed unipartite networks only have one type of node, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed unipartite networks can be conveniently represented as bipartite networks for module identification purposes. We report on an approach especially suited for module detection in bipartite networks, and we define a set of random networks that enable us to validate the approach.},

Yet real world data is rarely just graph-structured, but instead exhibits multiple facets, such as multivariate attributes, or spatial and temporal frames of reference. In an effort to display different facets of a graph, such a wealth of visualization techniques has been developed in the past that current surveys focus on a single additional facet only in order to enumerate and classify them. This report builds on existing graph visualization surveys for the four common facets of partitions, attributes, time, and space. It contributes a generic high-level categorization of faceted graph visualization that subsumes the existing classifications, which can be understood as facet-specific refinements of the resulting categories. Furthermore, it extends beyond existing surveys by applying the same categorization to graph visualizations with multiple facets. For each of the introduced categories and considered facets, this overview provides visualization examples to illustrate instances of their realization.},

  abstract = {Halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous-tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size or in spacing, thus generating a gradient-like effect. "Halftone" can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.Where continuous-tone imagery contains an infinite range of colors or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (pulse-width modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation) or both. This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: when the halftone dots are small, the human eye interprets the patterned areas as if they were smooth tones. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of continuous tones. For details, see film grain. Just as color photography evolved with the addition of filters and film layers, color printing is made possible by repeating the halftone process for each subtractive color – most commonly using what is called the "CMYK color model". The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create another optical effect:  full-color imagery.},

  abstract = {The human genome consists mainly of DNA, a macromolecule consisting of a long linear sequence of bases, tightly packed to fit in the relatively small nucleus. The packing gives rise to multiple hierarchical organizational levels. Recent research has shown that, along with the linear sequence, the spatial arrangement of the genome plays an important role in the genome’s function and activity. The visualization of both linear and spatial aspects of genome data is therefore necessary. In this thesis, we focus on the concept of continuous visual abstraction for multiscale data, applied to the visualization of the human genome. Visual abstraction is a concept inspired by illustrations that makes the job of visual processing simpler, by guiding the attention of the viewer to important aspects. We first extract characteristics of multiscale data and makes a parallel comparison between genome and astronomical data. The existing differences create the need for different approaches. A common point however is the need for continuous transitions that helps viewers grasp the relationships and relative size differences between scales. To satisfy the conditions posed by the two aspects of the multiscale genome data, we present two conceptual frameworks, based on the same data. The first framework, ScaleTrotter, represents the spatial structure of the genome, on all available levels. It gives users the freedom to travel from the nucleus of a cell to the atoms of the bases, passing through the different organizational levels of the genome. To make the exploration of the structure of all levels possible, smooth temporal transitions are used. Even though all the scales are not simultaneously visible, the temporal transition used superimposes two representations of the same element at consecutive scales emphasizing their relationship. To ensure the understandability and interactivity of the data, unnecessary parts of the data are abstracted away with the use of a scale-dependent camera. The second framework, Multiscale Unfolding, focuses on aspects that are not visible in ScaleTrotter: the linear sequence and a simultaneous overview of all the organizational levels. The data is straightened to unfold the packing that occurs on several levels in a way that conserves the connectivity between the elements. To represent all the available levels, we use smooth spatial transitions between the levels. These spatial transitions are based on the same concept of the temporal transitions of the previous framework, superimposing scales and emphasizing on their relationship and size difference. We introduce an interaction technique called Multiscale Zliding that allows the exploration of the data and further emphasizes the size differences between the levels. In each framework, one of either linear of spatial aspect of genome data is sacrificed to emphasize the other. The thesis concludes with a discussion about the possibility of combining the two frameworks, minimizing the sacrifices to explore the two equally important aspects of the genome. In this thesis, we take a step closer to fully understanding the activity of the genome.},

  abstract = {Des millions d’utilisateurs travaillent à l’aide de documents afin d’effectuer leurs tâches quotidiennes, mais les interfaces utilisateurs n’ont pas fondamentalement changé depuis leur première conception à la fin des années 70. Les ordinateurs d’aujourd’hui sont utilisés par une grande variété d’utilisateurs pour réaliser un large éventail de tâches, ce qui interroge les limites des interfaces actuelles. Je soutiens qu’en se concentrant sur les utilisateurs extrêmes et en adoptant une perspective fondée sur des principes de conception, nous pouvons concevoir des représentations efficaces et flexibles pour soutenir le travail de connaissance lié aux documents. J’étudie d’abord l’une des tâches les plus courantes, à savoir le traitement de texte dans le contexte des documents techniques. En nous concentrant sur les professionnels du droit, nous mettons en lumière les limites des logiciels de traitement de texte actuels. Les professionnels du droit doivent faire appel à leur mémoire pour gérer les dépendances et maintenir un vocabulaire cohérent dans leurs documentations. Pour résoudre ces problèmes, nous introduisons Textlets, des objets interactifs qui réifient les sélections de texte en éléments persistants. Nous présentons un prototype de preuve de concept démontrant plusieurs cas d’utilisation, notamment la recherche et le remplacement sélectifs, le comptage des mots et les mots alternatifs. L’évaluation observationnelle montre l’utilité et l’efficacité de Textlets, ce qui prouve la validité du concept. Au cours de mon travail avec des professionnels du droit, j’ai été initié à la rédaction et au dépôt de brevets. Dans le processus de brevetage, les avocats rédigent des demandes de brevet qui décrivent une invention donnée. Les examinateurs de brevets étudient la demande et décident si un brevet peut lui être accordé. En collaboration avec l’Office européen des brevets, j’ai étudié le processus de recherche et de révision des examinateurs de brevets. L’étude montre la nécessité de gérer le texte de plusieurs documents à travers diverses activités interconnectées, tout en suivant manuellement leur provenance. Je prolonge Textlets pour créer Passages, des objets de sélection de texte qui peuvent être manipulés, réutilisés et partagés entre plusieurs outils. Deux études d’utilisateurs montrent que Passages facilitent les pratiques des professionnels et permettent une plus grande réutilisation des informations. Ces deux projets ont conduit à un autre aspect important du travail intellectuel : la gestion des fichiers. Je me concentre sur les scientifiques, un autre exemple d’utilisateurs extrêmes, pour étudier leurs pratiques de gestion des documents. Les scientifiques travaillent avec une variété d’outils et ils ont des difficultés à utiliser le système de fichiers pour suivre et maintenir la cohérence entre des informations connexes mais distribuées. Nous avons créé FileWeaver, un système qui détecte automatiquement les dépendances entre les fichiers sans action explicite de l’utilisateur, suit leur historique et permet aux utilisateurs d’interagir directement avec les graphiques représentant ces dépendances et l’historique des versions. En rendant les dépendances entre fichiers visibles, FileWeaver facilite l’automatisation des flux de travail des scientifiques et des autres utilisateurs qui s’appuient sur le système de fichiers pour gérer leurs données. Je réfléchis à mon expérience de conception et d’évaluation de ces représentations et propose trois nouveaux principes de conception : granularité, individualité et synchronisation. Avec les résultats empiriques de ces utilisateurs extrêmes, la démonstration technologique de trois prototypes de preuve de concept et trois principes de conception, cette thèse démontre de nouvelles approches originales pour travailler avec des documents. Je soutiens qu’en adoptant une perspective fondée sur les principes et la théorie, nous pouvons contribuer à des concepts d’interface innovants},

  abstract = {Emics and etics. Since these terms were coined by linguist Kenneth Pike four decades ago, they have spread throughout the social sciences and humanities. Referring to the insider versus outsider, subjective versus objective view of the world, they represent important guideposts for researchers dealing with cultures other than their own. Written in the form of opposing position statements by Kenneth Pike and Marvin Harris, "Emics and Etics" explores the usage—and confusion surrounding the use—of these concepts today. Additional pieces include critical analyses by noted scholars, replies by each of the principals to his critics, and a summary piece surveying the use of these concepts outside of anthropology (in psychology, sociology, health, nursing, education, management, and other social science fields).

  abstract = {This paper describes the integration of perceptual guidelines from human vision with an Al-based mixed-initiative search strategy. The result is a visualization assistant called ViA, a system that collaborates with its users to identify perceptually salient visualizations for large multidimensional data sets. ViA applies the knowledge of low-level human vision to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a particular visualization for a given data set and analysis tasks and 2) rapidly direct its search toward new visualizations that are most likely to offer improvements over those seen to date. Context, domain expertise, and a high-level understanding of a data set are critical to identifying effective visualizations. We apply a mixed-initiative strategy that allows ViA and its users to share their different strengths and continually improve ViA's understanding of a user's preferences. We visualize historical weather conditions to compare ViA's search strategy to exhaustive analysis, simulated annealing, and reactive tabu search and to measure the improvement provided by mixed-initiative interaction. We also visualize intelligent agents competing in a simulated online auction to evaluate ViA's perceptual guidelines. Results from each study are positive, suggesting that ViA can construct high-quality visualizations for a range of real-world data sets.},

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

Mais, au-delà de cette période, les relevés statistiques sont si rares et fragmentaires que cette partie fondamentale de l'Histoire est encore très incertaine. M. Louis Henry avait déjà montré ("Population" avril-juin 1953) la richesse inexploitée que constituent les registres paroissiaux. Comme le dépouillement de ces registres à des fins démographiques soulève des difficultés techniques, il a rédigé, avec l'aide de M. Michel Fleury, archiviste-adjoint du département de la Seine et de la Ville de Paris, un manuel à l'intention des nombreux chercheurs qui travaillent sur les registres paroissiaux. Ce manuel, d'une utilité considérable, était impatiemment attendu. Les auteurs présentent ici leur ouvrage, en cours de publication par l'I.N.E.D.},

  abstract = {A compound graph is a frequently encountered type of data set. Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.},

  abstract = {The success of statistical machine learning (ML) methods made the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) so popular again, after the last AI winter. Meanwhile deep learning approaches even exceed human performance in particular tasks. However, such approaches have some disadvantages besides of needing big quality data, much computational power and engineering effort; those approaches are becoming increasingly opaque, and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles of such models they still lack explicit declarative knowledge. For example, words are mapped to high-dimensional vectors, making them unintelligible to humans. What we need in the future are context-adaptive procedures, i.e. systems that construct contextual explanatory models for classes of real-world phenomena. This is the goal of explainable AI, which is not a new field; rather, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself. While rule-based approaches of early AI were comprehensible “glass-box” approaches at least in narrow domains, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Maybe one step further is in linking probabilistic learning methods with large knowledge representations (ontologies) and logical approaches, thus making results re-traceable, explainable and comprehensible on demand.},

Datasets which describe such multi-entity relationships are often modeled as hypergraphs, that can be difficult to visualize, especially when these relationships evolve over time. HyperStorylines builds upon Storylines, enabling the aggregation and nesting of these dynamic, multi-entity relationships. We report on the design process of HyperStorylines, which was informed by discussions and workshops with data journalists; and on the results of a comparative study in which participants had to answer questions inspired by the tasks that journalists typically perform with such data. We observe that although HyperStorylines takes some practice to master, it performs better for identifying and characterizing relationships than the selected baseline visualization (PAOHVis) and was preferred overall.},

  abstract = {Background A number of publications have recently examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in genome biology, such as gene networks. The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure. Results We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained. Conclusion Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain.},

In the framework, a soft computing method produces a clustering of the graph and a visualization of it is provided using some graph drawing techniques. Through the visualization the user can then analyze the clustering and give “hints” that help the soft computing method to find better solutions. Hints include a variety of constraints for solutions, as well as direct manipulation of the previously computed clustering. The framework is flexible: it can accommodate several kinds of hints, clustering algorithms, and visualization techniques.},

The fisheye view aims to support a programmer's navigation and understanding by displaying those parts of the source code that have the highest degree of interest given the current focus. An experiment was conducted which compared the usability of the fisheye view with a common, linear presentation of source code. Sixteen participants performed tasks significantly faster with the fisheye view, although results varied dependent on the task type. The participants generally preferred the interface with the fisheye view. We analyse participants' interaction with the fisheye view and suggest how to improve its performance. In the calculation of the degree of interest, we suggest to emphasize those parts of the source code that are semantically related to the programmer's current focus.},

The contributions of the paper are three fold. First, we present quantitative results and statistical analyses of data from an online study in which approximately 800 subjects performed 10 types of group and network tasks in the four evaluated visualizations. Specifically, we show that BubbleSets is the best alternative for tasks involving group membership assessment; that visually encoding group information over basic node-link diagrams incurs an accuracy penalty of about 25 percent in solving network tasks; and that GMap's use of prominent group labels improves memorability. We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment. Second, we discuss visual characteristics that can explain the observed quantitative differences in the four visualizations and suggest design recommendations. This discussion is supported by a small scale eye-tracking study and previous results from the visualization literature. Third, we present an easily extensible user study methodology.},

  abstract = {The Venice Time Machine is an international scientific programme launched by the EPFL and the University Ca'Foscari of Venice with the generous support of the Fondation Lombard Odier. It aims at building a multidimensional model of Venice and its evolution covering a period of more than 1000 years. The project ambitions to reconstruct a large open access database that could be used for research and education. Thanks to a parternship with the Archivio di Stato in Venice, kilometers of archives are currently digitized, transcribed and indexed setting the base of the largest database ever created on Venetian documents. The State Archives of Venice contain a massive amount of hand-written documentation in languages evolving from medieval times to the 20th century. An estimated 80 km of shelves are filled with over a thousand years of administrative documents, from birth registrations, death certificates and tax statements, all the way to maps and urban planning designs. These documents are often very delicate and are occasionally in a fragile state of conservation. In complementary to these primary sources, the content of thousands of monographies have been indexed and made searchable. The documents digitised in the Venice Time Machine programme are intricately interweaved, telling a much richer story when they are cross-referenced. By combining this mass of information, it is possible to reconstruct large segments of the city's past: complete biographies, political dynamics, or even the appearance of buildings and entire neighborhoods. The information extracted from the primary and secondary sources are organized in a semantic graph of linked data and unfolded in space and time in an historical geographical information system. The resulting platform can serve for both research and education. About a hundred researchers and students collaborate already on this programme. A doctoral school is organised every year in Venice and several bachelor and master courses currently use the data produced in the context of the Venice Time Machine. Through all these initiatives, the Venice Time Machine explores how "big data of the past" can change research and education in historical sciences, hopefully paving the way towards a general methodology that could be applied to many other cities and archives.},

  abstract = {Visualization techniques are of increasing importance in exploring and analyzing large amounts of multidimensional information. One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are important in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets.},

While the capacity to collect and store new data rapidly grows, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower rates.

The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling these massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information by integrating human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research.

The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together theoreticians and practitioners from Information Visualization, HCI and Graph Drawing with a special focus on multivariate network visualization, id est, on graphs where the nodes and/or edges have additional (multidimensional) attributes. The integration of multivariate data into complex networks and their visual analysis is one of the big challenges not only in visualization, but also in many application areas. Thus, in order to support discussions related to the visualization of real world data, also invited researchers from selected application areas, especially bioinformatics, social sciences and software engineering. The unique "Dagstuhl climate" ensured an open and undisturbed atmosphere to discuss the state-of-the-art, new directions and open challenges of multivariate network visualization},

We review the nascent literature on topic modeling of literary archives, and present a case study, applying a topic model to the Papers of Thomas Jefferson. The lessons from this work suggest that the way forward is to provide scholars with more holistic support for visualization and exploration of topic model output, while integrating topic models with more traditional workflows oriented around assembling and refining sets of relevant documents. We describe our ongoing effort to develop a novel software system that implements these ideas.},

The lines involved are called edges of the graph1. An edge which connects A and B, i.e. whose endpoints are A and B, and which goes to A (and B) we shall designate by AB. It is possible that several edges are designated as AB. If A is an endpoint of edge k, we shall also say that A and k are incident to each other. If the set of vertices and the set of edges of a graph are both finite, the graph is called finite, otherwise infinite. An infinite graph has infinitely many edges but possibly only finitely many vertices (e.g., two vertices can be connected by infinitely many edges.)},

  abstract = {Network diagrams are a familiar graphic form that can express many different kinds of information. The problem of automating network-diagram layout has therefore received much attention. Previous research on network-diagram layout has focused on the problem of aesthetically optimal layout, using such criteria as the number of link crossings, the sum of all link lengths, and total diagram area. In this paper the authors propose a restatement of the network-diagram layout problem in which layout-aesthetic concerns are subordinated to perceptual-organization concerns. The authors present a notation for describing the visual organization of a network diagram. This notation is used in reformulating the layout task as a constrained-optimization problem in which constraints are derived from a visual-organization specification and optimality criteria are derived from layout-aesthetic considerations. Two new heuristic algorithms are presented for this version of the layout problem: one algorithm uses a rule-based strategy for computing a layout; the other is a massively parallel genetic algorithm. The authors demonstrate the capabilities of the two algorithms by testing them on a variety of network-diagram layout problems.{$<>$}},

Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states.},

Identified clusters (i.e., groups of similar members), however, can be very sensitive to small changes of the selected region, so that clustering results can be misleading and bias subsequent analyses. In this article, we - a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists-deliver visual analytics solutions to analyze the sensitivity of clustering results with respect to changes of a selected region. We propose an interactive visual interface that enables simultaneous visualization of a) the variation in composition of identified clusters (i.e., their robustness), b) the variability in cluster membership for individual ensemble members, and c) the uncertainty in the spatial locations of identified trends. We demonstrate that our solution shows meteorologists how representative a clustering result is, and with respect to which changes in the selected region it becomes unstable. Furthermore, our solution helps to identify those ensemble members which stably belong to a given cluster and can thus be considered similar. In a real-world application case we show how our approach is used to analyze the clustering behavior of different regions in a forecast of “Tropical Cyclone Karl”, guiding the user towards the cluster robustness information required for subsequent ensemble analysis.},

  abstract = {Many large real-world networks actually have a two-mode nature: their nodes may be separated into two classes, the links being between nodes of different classes only. Despite this, and despite the fact that many ad hoc tools have been designed for the study of special cases, very few exist to analyse (describe, extract relevant information) such networks in a systematic way. We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse large one-mode networks (the classical case) to the two-mode case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions. This makes it possible to evaluate their relevance in capturing properties of interest in two-mode networks.},

In this paper we show how background knowledge can be used to bias a partitional density-based clustering algorithm. Our work describes how labeled objects can be used to help the algorithm detecting suitable density parameters for the algorithm to extract density-based clusters in specific parts of the feature space. Considering the set of constraints estabilished by the labeled dataset we show that our algorithm, called SSDBSCAN, automatically finds density parameters for each natural cluster in a dataset. Four of the most interesting characteristics of SSDBSCAN are that (1) it only requires a single, robust input parameter, (2) it does not need any user intervention, (3) it automatically finds the noise objects according to the density of the natural clusters and (4) it is able to find the natural cluster structure even when the density among clusters vary widely. The algorithm presented in this paper is evaluated with artificial and real-world datasets, demonstrating better results when compared to other unsupervised and semi-supervised density-based approaches.},

Their book, accessible to complete beginners, offers detailed advice and practical tips on how to build a dataset from historical sources and how to categorize it according to specific research questions. Drawing on examples from works in social, political, economic, and cultural history, the book guides readers through a wide range of methods, including sampling, cross-tabulations, statistical tests, regression, factor analysis, network analysis, sequence analysis, event history analysis, geographical information systems, text analysis, and visualization. The requirements, advantages, and pitfalls of these techniques are presented in layperson’s terms, avoiding mathematical terminology.Conceived primarily for historians, the book will prove invaluable to other humanists, as well as to social scientists looking for a nontechnical introduction to quantitative methods. Covering the most recent techniques, in addition to others not often enough discussed, the book will also have much to offer to the most seasoned practitioners of quantification.},

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

  abstract = {The concept of networks has been important in the study of complex systems. In networks, links connect pairs of nodes forming complex structures. Studies have shown that networks not only contain structure but may also evolve in time. The addition of the temporal dimension adds complexity on the analysis and requests the development of innovative methods for the visualization of real-life networks. In this paper we introduce the Dynamic Network Visualization System (DyNetVis), a software tool for visualization of dynamic networks. The system provides several tools for user interaction and offers two coordinated visual layouts, named structural and temporal. Structural refers to standard network drawing techniques, in which a single snapshot of nodes and links are placed in a plane, whereas the temporal layout allows for simultaneously visualization of several temporal snapshots of the dynamic network. In addition, we also investigate two approaches for temporal layout visualization: (i) Recurrent Neighbors, a node ordering strategy that highlights frequent connections in time, and (ii) Temporal Activity Map (TAM), a layout technique with focus on nodes activity. We illustrate the applicability of the layouts and interaction functionalities provided by the system in two visual analysis case studies, demonstrating their advantages to improve the overall user experience on visualization and exploratory data analysis on dynamic networks.},

Due to the large amount of information on real-world temporal networks, increasing attention has been given to issues related to the visual scalability of network visualization layouts. However, visual clutter due to edge overlap remains the main challenge calling for efficient methods to improve the visual experience. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable node reordering approach for temporal network visualization, named Community-based Node Ordering (CNO), combining static community detection with node reordering techniques to enhance the identification of visual patterns. The perception of trends, periodicity, anomalies, and other temporal patterns, is facilitated, resulting in faster decision making. Our method helps not only the study of network activity patterns within communities but also the analysis of relatively large networks by breaking down its structure in smaller parts. Using CNO, we further propose a taxonomy to categorize activity patterns within communities. We performed a number of experiments and quantitative analyses using two real-world networks with distinct characteristics and showed that the proposed layout and taxonomy speed up the identification of patterns that would otherwise be difficult to see.},

The investigation presented covers an important change in the political culture from the Ancien Régime to the modern constitutional state in southwest Germany, and it raises the question of whether election processes affected traditional structures of representation based on kinship relationships and the ascription of political competence to an elite of notables. The analysis of kinship networks within the city council and city deputation, however, comes to the opposite conclusion—that kinship networks survive even in a system where each year people were newly elected. The analysis of voters’ alignments along kinship lines also demonstrates the power and persistence of kinship structures in the early nineteenth century and reflects the differences between kinship mobilization within agriculturally bound and urban artisan groups.},

The petitions expressed different group interests, articulated by craftsmen, merchants, entrepreneurs, and workers, who responded to current economic and social restraints. Another complex of petitions formulated requests regarding the constitution, the liberalization of the political system, or the organization of education, especially the separation of church and state. Another large mass of revolutionary petitions was addressed to the rulers or the ruling bodies of the different German states and was concerned with regional conflicts, and the adoption of ideas that were developed at national level.},

  abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

In this survey we discuss the importance of research in mixed-initiative systems and how it is different from visual analytics and other research fields. We present the conceptual architecture of a mixed-initiative visual analytics system (MIVAS) and the five key components that make up MIVASs (data wrangling, alternative discovery and comparison, parametric interaction, history tracking and exploration, and system agency and adaptation), which forms our main contribution. We compare and contrast different research that claims to be mixed-initiative against MIVASs and show how there is still a considerable amount of work that needs to be accomplished before any system can truly be mixed-initiative.},

  abstract = {The triumphant rise of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte over his Republican opponents has been the central theme of most narrative accounts of mid-nineteenth-century France, while resistance to the coup d'état generally has been neglected. By placing the insurrection of December 1851 in a broad perspective of socioeconomic and political development, Ted Margadant displays its full significance as a turning point in modern French history. He argues that, as the first expression of a new form of political participation on the part of the peasants, resistance to the coup was of greater importance than previously supposed. Furthermore, it provides and appropriate testing ground for more general theories of peasant movements and popular revolts.Using manuscript materials in French national and departmental archives that cover all the major areas of revolt, the author examines the insurrection in depth on a national scale. After a brief discussion of the main characteristics of the insurrection, he analyzes its economic and social foundations; the dialectic of repression and conspiracy that fostered the political crisis; and the armed mobilizations, violence, and massive arrests that exploded as the result. A final chapter considers the implications of the insurrection for larger issues in the social and political history of modern France.},

  abstract = {In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately~17\,000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic ‘revolutions’ around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.},

A Paris, Naples, Turin, Cagliari, Athènes, Helsinki, Saint-Pétersbourg et Madrid, des témoins ont accepté de consigner, dans des cahiers spécialement préparés, et suivant un même protocole d'enquête, une multitude de renseignements sur leurs rencontres. Ils ont de plus été interrogés, en détail, sur leur espace de relations. Des portraits, fins et souvent plaisants, émergent de cette enquête et éclairent les formes selon lesquelles les personnes agencent quotidiennement leur vie. Par leur dimension méthodologique, ces exercices révèlent les ambiguïtés inscrites dans la plupart des mesures et des hypothèses de travail bâties autour des réseaux. Ils montrent aussi que leur analyse permet de décrypter avec précision les mécanismes d'agrégation et de reproduction des maillages d'une société. Mieux, ils suggèrent enfin que l'optique individuelle, loin de réduire la portée de l'observation, est particulièrement bien adaptée à la compréhension des dynamiques sociales globales.},

Il s’appuie sur une enquête qui a permis de reconstituer les «~trajectoires de persécution~» des 992~Juifs de Lens pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, dont 527 seulement ont survécu. 491 ont été arrêtés, 468 ont été déportés et 449 ont été exterminés. Les données prosopographiques sont utilisées ici pour répondre à une question simple~: est-il possible de modéliser la persécution~? En d’autres termes, est-il possible de construire une représentation simplifiée mais heuristique des processus causaux complexes qui ont déterminé les chances de survie face à la persécution nazie à partir de données standardisées sur un nombre relativement important d’individus~? L’article discute les apports et les limites d’une succession de méthodes quantifiées~: celles qui s’inscrivent dans ce qu’Andrew Abbott appelle le «~programme standard~» des sciences sociales, ainsi que l’analyse des réseaux et l’analyse séquentielle. Pour chacune d’entre elles, sont plus particulièrement discutées les manières de rendre compte des interactions entre les individus, de l’historicité des comportements et des processus déterminant ces chances de survie. Les tentatives de modélisation à partir de données historiennes apportent ainsi de véritables renouvellements de connaissances, notamment lorsqu’elles sont menées de manière cumulative sur une même enquête. En passant d’une logique de propriétés individuelles à une logique de trajectoires interconnectées, ces approches permettent de mieux comprendre les interactions sociales et locales, et offrent ainsi des perspectives stimulantes pour la microhistoire de l’Holocauste.           ,              Abstracts             This article offers a detailed examination of the contributions and limitations of historical modeling based on the case of the Shoah. It is founded on an investigation that reconstructed the “persecution trajectories” of the 992 Jews of Lens during the Second World War, only 527 of whom survived the conflict. 491 were arrested, 468 were deported, and 449 were exterminated. Prosopographic data are used here to answer a simple question: Is it possible to model persecution? In other words, is it possible to construct a simplified but heuristic representation of the complex causal processes that determined chances of surviving Nazi persecution using standardized data on a relatively large number of individuals? To answer this question, the paper discusses the contributions and limitations of a series of quantified methods: those that form what Andrew Abbott calls the “standard curriculum” of the social sciences, but also network analysis and sequential analysis. For each of these methods, we focus on how they report both the interactions between individuals and the historicity of the behaviors and processes that determine their chances of survival. Attempts to model using historical data thus bring about a real renewal of knowledge, especially when they are carried out cumulatively on the same survey. By moving from a logic of individual properties to a logic of interconnected trajectories, these approaches provide a better understanding of social and local interactions. As a result, they offer stimulating perspectives for the microhistory of the Holocaust.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) in archaeology has become important for a range of theoretical and methodological approaches that can more generally be characterized as relational. They are relational in that it is the ties between actors (or nodes) that define social connections. Archaeologists are currently employing a diversity of theoretical approaches to networks, and the perspective taken in this review is that SNA can provide insights into a number of different social processes using different theories. Following a brief historical overview, I discuss two aspects of SNA: the structural position of the actor or node, and characterizations of whole networks. I then summarize several broad classes of archaeological networks: historical, spatial, and material. I conclude with a call for more bridging approaches to span alternative theoretical and methodological approaches in the archaeology of networks.},

Wherever two or more people are functioning as a social group that group not only consists of those individuals, but, more important perhaps, if that is possible, than the individuals themselves and without which their functioning as a social group cauld not be expressed, are the relations which maintain between them. It is these intangible, imponderable and invisible aspects of the situation which enable the mathematical sum of a certain number of individuals to function as a social group. Dr. Moreno's book might he described briefly as a study of these relations between individuals. Dr. Moreno develops a technique for a process of classification which is calculated, among other things, to bring individuals together who are capable of harmonious inter-personal relationships, and so creating a social group which can function at the maximum efficiency and with the minimum of disruptive tendencies and processes.

Ils jalonnent les études consacrées au rôle de la famille dans la vie économique et politique. Évidemment, on s'est surtout préoccupé d'établir l'éventail des normes et des stratégies des groupes ou catégories qui ont servi de base à l'élaboration d'une image de la stratification sociale : commerçants, ploutocrates, familles de notables, etc. Ces catégories sont perçues comme étant constituées d'individus ou d'ensembles corporatifs qui fonctionnent, à la fois, comme agents mus par une exigence de profit et comme acteurs imbriqués dans la logique des liens primaires. Il a pu en résulter des strates d'explications homogènes mais qui, superposées, n'offrent aucun rapport les unes avec les autres., SummaryBeginning in 1760, a number of entirely ordinary political disputes—involving the problem of contreband goods—provide us with an opportunity to study the practices and strategies linking a specific group of persons, and the history, over three generations, of four interconnected families. This reconstructed network of Personal relations constitutes a field for the analysis, on the one hand, of the motivations of economic agents, and on the other hand, of the functioning of institutions. The network and its machinery, based on family relations, articulate a social space in which the « organization » of enterprises and the structures of political power interact with each other. The present study attempts to clarify this articulation through an analysis of 1) the roles played by members of the suites of various representatives of the Crown; 2) the mechanisms which informed the business affairs of a large body of contractors; and 3) the role of honor, family relations and inheritance in the strategies of the actors monopolizing the controlling functions of the economy and of politics.},

  abstract = {People's associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered "non-colorable" (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.},

As one consequence, we obtain a single, straightforward proof that role equivalences form lattices. Our formalization focuses on the evolution of roles from arbitrary initial conditions and thereby generalizes notions of relative and iterated roles that have been suggested previously. In addition to the unified structure result this provides a micro-foundation for the emergence of roles. Considering the genesis of roles may explain, and help overcome, the problem that social networks rarely exhibit interesting role equivalences of the traditional kind. Finally, we hint at ways to further generalize the role concept to multivariate networks.},

  abstract = {Modern organizations store data in centralized, schema-less repositories called data lakes that provide a common interface for users to access and share data. However, the scale and complexity of these data lakes can make it challenging for users to discover relevant data (attributes and records) to prepare task-specific subsets. To address this challenge, we leverage the data, usage logs, and associated meta-data within a data lake and provision two kinds of auxiliary information: (1) quality – the validity of data required to perform analytical tasks; and (2) usage – the utilization of data across multiple users. Through a design study with 14 domain experts, we integrate this information into a visual data preparation and analysis tool, DataPilot. Specifically, DataPilot computes data quality and usage scores, presents visual cues to distinguish between “good” and “bad” data characteristics, and provides graphical user interface controls as interaction affordances to assist users during data preparation and analysis. Through a study with 36 users, we investigate how DataPilot assists users in navigating a large and unknown dataset within a data lake, preparing a relevant subset, and building a visualization dashboard. Our findings reveal that quality and usage information together help users prepare more effective subsets with greater success and confidence. However, the usage information warrants some caution if they reduce exploration of valid data in favor of exploitation of popular data. Our findings also call for visual data analysis tools to prioritize and integrate data preparation affordances directly into analysis workflows to foster more accurate and objective applications of data.},

NetPanorama provides a JSON specification to easily customise each of these steps and explore alternatives. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our grammar through a wide range of examples and discuss how it can reproduce a variety of existing network visualisation techniques for multivariate, temporal, and geographic networks, including matrices, various node-link layouts, aggregation and projections, and small multiples.

In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, tree-table multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of scholars, papers, and citation metrics and a multitype network of story characters, places, books, etc.},

We study the middle 13th century in Czech lands, where a rigid political structure of noble families surrounding the monarchs led to the uprising of part of the nobility. Having collected data on approximately 2,400 noblemen from 576 charters, we attempted to uncover social network features pointing to the rebellion and expose the noblemen who joined it. We observed, among other such quantifiable features, assortativity increasing before and resetting to random after the rebellion, a drop in the number of stable connections and subgraph similarity between yearly networks and regional titles (burgraves) rising in centrality above royal court officials in that period. The presented methods can be directly translated to other person-document data of comparable or larger sizes, and we hope it can help detect or disambiguate the timing of similar major events and the roles of people involved in them.},

À partir d’une lecture de ces débats et des travaux en sciences sociales souvent regroupés sous ce label, l’article soutient que cette situation polarisée a de fortes chances de perdurer tant que la discussion s’organise autour du concept mal défini de big data. Il propose de distinguer différents types de données souvent regroupées sous ce terme. Il montre ce faisant que les big data souvent évoquées ne sont qu’un aspect limité d’une transformation bien plus importante\,: la disponibilité croissante et massive de données numériques, qui pose des questions nouvelles à nos disciplines. Quatre aspects sont plus particulièrement explorés\,: les réorganisations disciplinaires, les transformations des méthodes quantitatives, l’accès et la gestion des données, les objets des sciences sociales et leur rapport à la théorie.},

  abstract = {A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.},

The visualization appearing quickly, unfolding, and improving with time, enables users to make early decisions. However, early intermediate results may not represent the truth, thus misleading the users. We conduct a user study using realistic data to understand if users make mistakes when using progressive bar charts with/without confidence intervals, and propose new designs visualizing the bars’ history to help improve early decision-making. Our results show that overall users are able to make accurate and early comparisons with about 90\% accuracy, with only a slightly worse accuracy and response time compared to statistical tests. We find our proposed bar chart design with history is comparable to bar charts with error bars in performance and qualitative feedback indicates preference for designs with history.},

It incorporates algorithms and software tools from various subfields of computer science, including computer vision, document analysis and recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning, to convert images of ancient manuscripts, letters, diaries, and early printed texts automatically into a digital format usable in data mining and information retrieval systems. Within the past twenty years, as libraries, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions have scanned an increasing volume of their historical document archives, the need to transcribe the full text from these collections has become acute. Since Historical Document Processing encompasses multiple sub-domains of computer science, knowledge relevant to its purpose is scattered across numerous journals and conference proceedings. This paper surveys the major phases of, standard algorithms, tools, and datasets in the field of Historical Document Processing, discusses the results of a literature review, and finally suggests directions for further research.},

  abstract = {Finding patterns in graphs has become a vital challenge in many domains from biological systems, network security, to finance (e.g., finding money laundering rings of bankers and business owners). While there is significant interest in graph databases and querying techniques, less research has focused on helping analysts make sense of underlying patterns within a group of subgraph results. Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents. We also evaluate VIGOR with a within-subjects study, demonstrating VIGOR's ease of use over a leading graph database management system, and its ability to help analysts understand their results at higher speed and make fewer errors.},

Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our approach using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists. We believe our clustering approach offers a novel constructive method to iteratively build knowledge while avoiding being overly influenced by the results of often randomly selected black-box clustering algorithms.},

However, few social network analysis tools are designed for this type of network, and existing ones rarely provide enough interactions to answer complex sociological questions.We present a new visual analytics system allowing to explore this type of network. In particular, we designed a visual query system specifically for this data model, allowing social scientists to easily apply filters on the topology and attributes of a network. We demonstrate how the interface coupled with the query system can be used to answer sociological questions with one real-world use case based on construction contracts.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Analogous to biological sequence comparison, comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.Results: We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of nodes ‘touching’ k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes ‘touching’ k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions of graphlets with 2–5 nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets), if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the available CPU. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 graphlet degree distributions into a network ‘agreement’ measure which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, resulting from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as from curated databases, are better modeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdös–Rény, random scale-free, or Barabási–Albert scale-free networks.Availability: Software executables are available upon request.Contact:natasha@ics.uci.edu},

The term, provenance, has been used in a variety of ways to describe different types of records and histories related to visualization. The existing body of provenance research has grown to a point where the consolidation of design knowledge requires cross-referencing a variety of projects and studies spanning multiple domain areas. We present an organizational framework of the different types of provenance information and purposes for why they are desired in the field of visual analytics. Our organization is intended to serve as a framework to help researchers specify types of provenance and coordinate design knowledge across projects. We also discuss the relationships between these factors and the methods used to capture provenance information. In addition, our organization can be used to guide the selection of evaluation methodology and the comparison of study outcomes in provenance research},

Charticulator is our response to most existing chart construction interfaces that require authors to choose from predefined chart layouts, thereby precluding the construction of novel charts. In contrast, Charticulator transforms a chart specification into mathematical layout constraints and automatically computes a set of layout attributes using a constraint-solving algorithm to realize the chart. It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools. In addition to describing Charticulator's conceptual framework and design, we present three forms of evaluation: a gallery to illustrate its expressiveness, a user study to verify its usability, and a click-count comparison between Charticulator and three existing tools. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potentials of Charticulator as well as directions for future research. Charticulator is available with its source code at https://charticulator.com.},

G-Tries encapsulate common sub-structure, and with the aid of symmetry breaking conditions and a customized canonization methodology, we are able to efficiently search for several colored patterns at the same time.

  abstract = {The ability to find and count subgraphs of a given network is an important non trivial task with multidisciplinary applicability. Discovering network motifs or computing graphlet signatures are two examples of methodologies that at their core rely precisely on the subgraph counting problem. Here we present the g-trie, a data-structure specifically designed for discovering subgraph frequencies. We produce a tree that encapsulates the structure of the entire graph set, taking advantage of common topologies in the same way a prefix tree takes advantage of common prefixes. This avoids redundancy in the representation of the graphs, thus allowing for both memory and computation time savings. We introduce a specialized canonical labeling designed to highlight common substructures and annotate the g-trie with a set of conditional rules that break symmetries, avoiding repetitions in the computation. We introduce a novel algorithm that takes as input a set of small graphs and is able to efficiently find and count them as induced subgraphs of a larger network. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithms, focusing on efficiency and scalability on a set of diversified complex networks. Results show that g-tries are able to clearly outperform previously existing algorithms by at least one order of magnitude.},

Ciceros Briefverkehr illustriert, wie komplexe Geflechte aus Verbindlichkeiten und gelegentlichen Abneigungen bei Senatsdebatten und Entscheidungen über öffentliche Auszeichnungen zum Tragen kamen und welche Mittel den Betroffenen zur Durchsetzung ihres Anliegens offenstanden. Somit geben sie uns auch einen wertvollen Blick auf die Bedeutung aristokratischen Prestiges, dessen standesinterne Verhandlung und die politische Praxis am Ende der Republik frei.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates how mathematical and statistical tools designed to handle relational data may be useful to help decipher the most important features and defects of a large historical database and to gain knowledge about a corpus made of several thousand documents. Such a relational model is generally enough to address a wide variety of problems, including most databases containing relational tables. In mathematics, it is referred to as a 'network' or a 'graph'. The article's purpose is to emphasize how a relevant relational model of a historical corpus can serve as a theoretical framework which makes available automatic data mining methods designed for graphs. By such methods, for one thing, consistency checking can be performed so as to extract possible transcription errors or interpretation errors during the transcription automatically. Moreover, when the database is so large that a human being is unable to gain much knowledge by even an exhaustive manual exploration, relational data mining can help elucidate the database's main features. First, the macroscopic structure of the relations between entities can be emphasized with the help of network summaries automatically produced by classification methods. A complementary point of view is obtained via local summaries of the relation structure: a set of network-related indicators can be calculated for each entity, singling out, for instance, highly connected entities. Finally, visualisation methods dedicated to graphs can be used to give the user an intuitive understanding of the database. Additional information can be superimposed on such network visualisations, making it possible intuitively to link the relations between entities using attributes that describe each entity. This overall approach is here illustrated with a huge corpus of medieval notarial acts, containing several thousand transactions and involving a comparable number of persons.},

  abstract = {This article studies the relationship between gender and entrepreneurship in Andalusia, a region in the south of Spain, between 1886 and 1959. The aim of the text is to answer the question: Were women active in entrepreneurship, or merely pieces in the economic strategies of the males who governed their families? To do this, a database built from the commercial registers containing more than 8,000 companies is used. The results obtained, by way of a combination of quantitative and qualitative research, as well as the application of the Social Network Analysis, indicate that the women who participated in the forming of multi-owner firms were subject to the decisions of their male partners, and hardly had any opportunities to develop an active business role. Female subordination is explained by the sociocultural characteristics of the institutional framework as well as the late economic development of the region.},

  abstract = {Task taxonomies for graph and network visualizations focus on tasks commonly encountered when analyzing graph connectivity and topology. However, in many application fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology (protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs), connectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering, and hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as BubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering, but evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of standardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new set of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of group-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we characterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of abstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the task taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for the recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and categorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected in controlled experiments.},

  abstract = {We present a novel uncertain network visualization technique based on node-link diagrams. Nodes expand spatially in our probabilistic graph layout, depending on the underlying probability distributions of edges. The visualization is created by computing a two-dimensional graph embedding that combines samples from the probabilistic graph. A Monte Carlo process is used to decompose a probabilistic graph into its possible instances and to continue with our graph layout technique. Splatting and edge bundling are used to visualize point clouds and network topology. The results provide insights into probability distributions for the entire network—not only for individual nodes and edges. We validate our approach using three data sets that represent a wide range of network types: synthetic data, protein–protein interactions from the STRING database, and travel times extracted from Google Maps. Our approach reveals general limitations of the force-directed layout and allows the user to recognize that some nodes of the graph are at a specific position just by chance.},

It is argued that the concept of social network provides a powerful model for social structure, and that a number of important formal methods of social network analysis can be discerned. Social network analysis has been used in studies of kinship structure, social mobility, science citations, contacts among members of deviant groups, corporate power, international trade exploitation, class structure, and many other areas. A review of the formal models proposed in graph theory, multidimensional scaling, and algebraic topology is followed by extended illustrations of social network analysis in the study of community structure and interlocking directorships.},

In order to guide and systematize research endeavors in this area, we provide a conceptual framework for visual parameter space analysis problems.

It contains three major components: (1) a data flow model that helps to abstractly describe visual parameter space analysis problems independent of their application domain; (2) a set of four navigation strategies of how parameter space analysis can be supported by visualization tools; and (3) a characterization of six analysis tasks. Based on our framework, we analyze and classify the current body of literature, and identify three open research gaps in visual parameter space analysis. The framework and its discussion are meant to support visualization designers and researchers in characterizing parameter space analysis problems and to guide their design and evaluation processes.},

  abstract = {J'étudie les avantages et limitations des casques de réalité augmentée (RA) pour l'exploration collaborative de données 3D. Avant d’entamer mes travaux, je voyais dans ces casques des avantages liés à leurs capacités immersives : ils fusionnent les espaces interactifs, de visualisation, de collaboration et physique des utilisateurs. Plusieurs collaborateurs peuvent voir et interagir directement avec des visuels 3D ancrés dans le monde réel. Ces casques reposent sur une vision stéréoscopique 3D qui fournit une perception de profondeur accrue par rapport aux écrans 2D, aidant les utilisateurs à mieux comprendre leurs données 3D. Laissant les utilisateurs se voir les uns les autres, il est possible de transitionner sans effort d’une phase de discussion à une phase d'exploration. Ces casques permettant aux utilisateurs d’interagir au sein de l’espace de travail de manière directe, rapide et intuitive en 3D, donnent des indices sur les intentions d'une personne aux autres. Par exemple, le fait de déplacer un objet en le saisissant est un indice fort sur les intentions de cette personne. Enfin, en n'occultant pas le monde réel, les outils habituels mais importants tels que les postes de travail restent facilement accessibles dans cet environnement. Cela étant, et bien qu’ils soient étudiés depuis des décennies, la puissance de calcul de ces casques avant la récente sortie de l'HoloLens en 2016 n'était pas suffisante pour une exploration efficace de données 3D telles que des données océaniques. De plus, les chercheurs précédemment étaient plus intéressés par comment rendre la RA possible que par comment utiliser la RA. Malgré toutes leurs qualités, il y a donc peu de travaux qui traitent de l'exploration de jeux de données 3D. Finalement, les casques de RA ne fournissent pas d'entrées 2D qui sont couramment utilisées avec les outils d'exploration actuels tels que ParaView et les logiciels de CAO, avec lesquels entre autre scientifiques et ingénieurs sont déjà efficaces. Je théorise donc dans cette thèse les situations où ces casques sont préférables. Ils semblent préférables lorsque l'objectif est de partager des idées, d'explorer des modèles ensemble et lorsque les outils d'exploration peuvent être minimaux par rapport à ce que les postes de travail fournissent, et ou la plupart des travaux et simulations préalables peuvent être effectués à l'avance. J'associe alors les casques de RA à des tablettes tactiles. J'utilise ces casques pour fusionner la visualisation, certaines interactions 3D et les espaces de collaboration dans l'espace physique des utilisateurs, et les tablettes pour la saisie 2D et l'interface utilisateur graphique habituelle que la plupart des logiciels proposent.J’étudie ensuite l'interaction de bas niveau nécessaire à l'exploration de données. Cela concerne la sélection de points et de régions dans des données 3D à l'aide de ce système hybride. Comme cette thèse vise à étudier les casques de RA dans des environnements collaboratifs, j’étudie également leurs capacités à adapter le visuel à chaque collaborateur pour un objet 3D ancré donné, similairement au "What-You-See-Is-What-I-See" relaxé qui permet par exemple à plusieurs utilisateurs de voir et modifier simultanément différentes parties d'un document partagé. Enfin, j’étudie en ce moment l'utilisation de mon système pour l'exploration collaborative en 3D des jeux de données océaniques sur lesquels travaillent mes collaborateurs du Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht en Allemagne. Pour résumer, cette thèse fournit un état de l'art de la RA à des fins collaboratifs, fournit un aperçu de l'impact de la directivité de l'interaction 3D sur l'exploration de donnée 3D, et donne aux concepteurs un aperçu de l'utilisation de la RA pour l'exploration collaborative de données scientifique 2D et 3D, en mettant l'accent sur le domaine océanographique.},

  abstract = {Visual exploration and analysis of multidimensional data becomes increasingly difficult with increasing dimensionality. We want to understand the relationships between dimensions of data, but lack flexible techniques for exploration beyond low-order relationships. Current visual techniques for multidimensional data analysis focus on binary conjunctive relationships between dimensions. Recent techniques, such as cross-filtering on an attribute relationship graph, facilitate the exploration of some higher-order conjunctive relationships, but require a great deal of care and precision to do so effectively. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressive power of existing visual querying systems and describes a more flexible approach in which users can explore n-ary conjunctive inter- and intra- dimensional relationships by interactively constructing queries as visual hypergraphs. In a hypergraph query, nodes represent subsets of values and hyperedges represent conjunctive relationships. Analysts can dynamically build and modify the query using sequences of simple interactions. The hypergraph serves not only as a query specification, but also as a compact visual representation of the interactive state. Using examples from several domains, focusing on the digital humanities, we describe the design considerations for developing the querying system and incorporating it into visual analysis tools. We analyze query expressiveness with regard to the kinds of questions it can and cannot pose, and describe how it simultaneously expands the expressiveness of and is complemented by cross-filtering.},

The results of central attacks with respect to attacked colonial force, member of attack alliances, and year and location of attack are discussed and compared to a qualitative analysis of the data.

  abstract = {A common scheme for discovering overlapping communities in a network is to use a seeding process followed by an expansion process. Most seeding methods are either too complex to scale to large networks or too simple to select high-quality seeds. Additionally, the non-principled functions used by most expansion methods lead to poor performances when applied to diverse networks. This paper proposes a new method that transforms a network into a corpus. Each edge is treated as a document, and all the network nodes are treated as terms of the corpus. We propose an effective seeding method that selects seeds as a training set, and a principled expansion method based on semi-supervised learning that classifies the edges. We compared our new algorithm with four other community detection algorithms on a wide range of synthetic and empirical networks. Our experimental results show that the new algorithm significantly improved the clustering performance in most cases. Furthermore, the time complexity of the new algorithm is linear with respect to the number of edges, which means that the technique can be scaled to large networks.},

Evaluations of animated approaches focus on dynamic stability for preserving the viewer's mental map or, in general, compare animated diagrams to timeline-based ones. Finally, we identify and discuss challenges for future research.},

Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. In this paper, we present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multidimensional databases that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table-based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We first identify several application scenarios for the resultant ‘knowledge reuse’ framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three effective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively different application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) is a core pursuit of analyzing social networks today. In addition to the usual statistical techniques of data analysis, these networks are investigated using SNA measures. It helps in understanding the dependencies between social entities in the data, characterizing their behaviors and their effect on the network as a whole and over time. Therefore, this article attempts to provide a succinct overview of SNA in diverse topological networks (static, temporal, and evolving networks) and perspective (ego-networks). As one of the primary applicability of SNA is in networked data mining, we provide a brief overview of network mining models as well; by this, we present the readers with a concise guided tour from analysis to mining of networks.

Although some research is being done in this area, the pace at which new technologies and technical talents are becoming available is far too slow to meet the urgent need. National Visualization and Analytics Center's goal is to advance the state of the science to enable analysts to detect the expected and discover the unexpected from massive and dynamic information streams and databases consisting of data of multiple types and from multiple sources, even though the data are often conflicting and incomplete. Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the following focus areas: (i) analytical reasoning techniques, (ii) visual representations and interaction techniques, (iii) data representations and transformations, (iv) techniques to support production, presentation, and dissemination of analytical results. The R\&D agenda for visual analytics addresses technical needs for each of these focus areas, as well as recommendations for speeding the movement of promising technologies into practice. This article provides only the concise summary of the R\&D agenda. We encourage reading, discussion, and debate as well as active innovation toward the agenda for visual analysis.},

Analysts regularly (if not always self-consciously) choose between adopting and avoiding formal representations of social processes. Despite widespread prejudices to the contrary, formalisms are available and helpful for all sorts of social scientific evidence, including those commonly labeled as qualitative. Available formalisms vary in two important regards: (1) from direct to analogical representation of the evidence at hand; and (2) from numerical to topological correspondence between formalism and evidence. Adoption of formalisms facilitates the identification of erroneous arguments, hence the correction of analytic errors and the production of more adequate explanations.},

But in the past two decades a host of scholars have written microhistorically-inflected studies of men and women whose lives transcended narrowly bounded geographical, religious, and linguistic areas. The article assesses what these studies have in common with and how they differ from the main contributions that Italian microhistorians articulated in publications, which appeared from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. It then suggests complementary and alternative ways of drawing inspiration from Italian microhistory to nourish the future agenda of global history.},

Hypergraphs can be used to model networks of business partners or co-authorship networks with multiple authors per article. A dynamic hypergraph evolves over discrete time slots. PAOH represents vertices as parallel horizontal bars and hyperedges as vertical lines, using dots to depict the connections to one or more vertices. We describe a prototype implementation of Parallel Aggregated Ordered Hypergraph, report on a usability study with 9 participants analyzing publication data, and summarize the improvements made. Two case studies and several examples are provided. We believe that PAOH is the first technique to provide a highly readable representation of dynamic hypergraphs. It is easy to learn and well suited for medium size dynamic hypergraphs (50-500 vertices) such as those commonly generated by digital humanities projects—our driving application domain.},

  abstract = {People often rank and order data points as a vital part of making decisions. Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user's data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user's subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings. Our proposed approach makes powerful machine learning techniques more usable to those who may not have expertise in these areas.},

Our work marks a natural progression of spectral clustering from the original passive unsupervised formulation to our active semi-supervised formulation. We follow the widely used area of constrained clustering and allow supervision in the form of pair wise relations between two nodes: Must-Link and Cannot-Link. Unlike most previous constrained clustering work, our constraints are specified incrementally by querying an oracle (domain expert). Since in practice, each query comes with a cost, our goal is to maximally improve the result with as few queries as possible. The advantages of our approach include: 1) it is principled by querying the constraints which maximally reduce the expected error, 2) it can incorporate both hard and soft constraints which are prevalent in practice. We empirically show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approach, namely constrained spectral clustering with randomly selected constraints, on UCI benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Exploratory visualization of 3D data is fundamental in many scientific domains. Traditionally, experts use a PC workstation and rely on mouse and keyboard to interactively adjust the view to observe the data. This setup provides immersion through interaction---users can precisely control the view and the parameters, but it does not provide any depth clues which can limit the comprehension of large and complex 3D data. Virtual or augmented reality (V/AR) setups, in contrast, provide visual immersion with stereoscopic views. Although their benefits have been proven, several limitations restrict their application to existing workflows, including high setup/maintenance needs, difficulties of precise control, and, more importantly, the separation from traditional analysis tools. To benefit from both sides, we thus investigated a hybrid setting combining an AR environment with a traditional PC to provide both interactive and visual immersions for 3D data exploration. We closely collaborated with particle physicists to understand their general working process and visualization requirements to motivate our design. First, building on our observations and discussions with physicists, we built up a prototype that supports fundamental tasks for exploring their datasets. This prototype treated the AR space as an extension to the PC screen and allowed users to freely interact with each using the mouse. Thus, experts could benefit from the visual immersion while using analysis tools on the PC. An observational study with 7 physicists in CERN validated the feasibility of such a hybrid setting, and confirmed the benefits. We also found that the large canvas of the AR and walking around to observe the data in AR had a great potential for data exploration. However, the design of mouse interaction in AR and the use of PC widgets in AR needed improvements. Second, based on the results of the first study, we decided against intensively using flat widgets in AR. But we wondered if using the mouse for navigating in AR is problematic compared to high degrees of freedom (DOFs) input, and then attempted to investigate if the match or mismatch of dimensionality between input and output devices play an important role in users’ performance. Results of user studies (that compared the performance of using mouse, space mouse, and tangible tablet paired with the screen or the AR space) did not show that the (mis-)match was important. We thus concluded that the dimensionality was not a critical point to consider, which suggested that users are free to choose any input that is suitable for a specific task. Moreover, our results suggested that the mouse was still an efficient tool compared to high DOFs input. We can therefore validate our design of keeping the mouse as the primary input for the hybrid setting, while other modalities should only serve as an addition for specific use cases. Next, to support the interaction and to keep the background information while users are walking around to observe the data in AR, we proposed to add a mobile device. We introduced a novel approach that augments tactile interaction with pressure sensing for 3D object manipulation/view navigation. Results showed that this method could efficiently improve the accuracy, with limited influence on completion time. We thus believe that it is useful for visualization purposes where a high accuracy is usually demanded. Finally, we summed up in this thesis all the findings we have and came up with an envisioned setup for a realistic data exploration scenario that makes use of a PC workstation, an AR headset, and a mobile device. The work presented in this thesis shows the potential of combining a PC workstation with AR environments to improve the process of 3D data exploration and confirms its feasibility, all of which will hopefully inspire future designs that seamlessly bring immersive visualization to existing scientific workflows.},

Nevertheless, there are still some fundamental issues remaining to be addressed, and an important one is what factors affect the accuracy of an ensemble, and to what extent they do, which is thus taken as the main topic of this paper. The factors studied include the accuracy of individual models, the diversity among the individual models in an ensemble, decision-making strategy, and the number of the members used for constructing an ensemble. This paper firstly describes the conceptual and theoretical analyses on these factors, and then presents the possible relationships between them.

  abstract = {In the past two decades, social network analysis (SNA) has become a major analytical paradigm in sociology and now occupies a strategic place in disciplinary debates on a wide variety of issues. Historians, however, have been slow to adopt the approach for at least three reasons. First, the conceptual orientation of sociologists practicing historical social network analysis (HSNA) remains unfamiliar to the majority of professional historians. Just when SNA was maturing in the late 1980s and 1990s, the interdisciplinary interest in social science theory among historians, so characteristic of the 1970s and early 1980s, began to wane. The subsequent turn toward post modernist thinking in history left the profession increasingly uninformed about both classical and contemporary social theory. Second, those quantitatively-oriented historians who might be predisposed to use SNA's specialized statistical methods constitute less than a quarter of the profession today, thus the risk of SNA finding its way into mainstream historical scholarship is low to start. Third, SNA's data requirements are formidable. SNA demands evidence of social interaction among all members of a social system for a variety of behaviors, and thus necessitates a broad range of high-quality records for the place, time and activities being studied. Because historians are plagued by an incomplete historical record and imperfect understandings of past social relations, HSNA remains an inherently problematic enterprise. Yet despite conceptual, methodological and evidentiary obstacles, SNA possesses real potential for historical analysis.},

Now, sophisticated mathematics and computer programming permit sophisticated network models — networks seen as sets of links, networks seen as generated structures, and networks seen as flow processes. Although network thinking has shown a dramatic rise from the “Anthropology Today” of 1953 to the current anthropology of 1978, it is predicted to soar in the next quarter century, much of the weighty burden of network analysis having been lifted from us by ever more rapid electronic data processing.},

As a result, there is an increasing need to identify and taxonomize the existing scholarship. Such an organization of the research landscape will provide a complete picture of the current state of inquiry and identify knowledge gaps or possible avenues for further investigation. In this STAR, we aim to produce a comprehensive survey of work in the data visualization and visual analytics field that focus on the analysis of user interaction and provenance data. We structure our survey around three primary questions: (1) WHY analyze provenance data, (2) WHAT provenance data to encode and how to encode it, and (3) HOW to analyze provenance data. A concluding discussion provides evidence-based guidelines and highlights concrete opportunities for future development in this emerging area. The survey and papers discussed can be explored online interactively at https://provenance-survey.caleydo.org.},

  abstract = {Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools that allow us to uncover organizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.},

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user’s intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

  abstract = {Node-link diagrams are widely used to visualise networks. However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in 'hairball' visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology---finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high-density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low-density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to a certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.},

These population registers (Rejestr mieszkancow) are located in the Lublin archives; they list all the inhabitants, apartment by apartment, indicating the age and religion of each of them. More exceptionally, the population register opened in 1932 records the movements of each individual up to 1951, indicating for example the date and place of destinations (Warsaw, Lublin as well as Paris, Buenos Aires, Cuba, or Costa Rica…), as well as other information. It also mentions the deportation of the Jews arrested in Lubartów in April 1942 and sent to the Belzec extermination camp. Therefore, these registers offer a remarkable starting-point for our research, as it allows assessing the population status in 1932 and mentions various population movements.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic graphs are challenging to visualize using the traditional node-link diagram. Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difficult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell, on average, within 11\% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these findings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated visualizations for probabilistic networks.},

Since one-mode projection is always less informative than the bipartite representation, a proper weighting method is required to better retain the original information. In this article, inspired by the network-based resource-allocation dynamics, we raise a weighting method which can be directly applied in extracting the hidden information of networks, with remarkably better performance than the widely used global ranking method as well as collaborative filtering. This work not only provides a creditable method for compressing bipartite networks, but also highlights a possible way for the better solution of a long-standing challenge in modern information science: How to do a personal recommendation.},
